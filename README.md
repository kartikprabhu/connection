Connection
==========

Connection is a set of tools that I use on Parallel Transport to talk to the rest of the Web. Right now it only includes a basic tool for sending webmentions and a microformats parser â€” though I plan to add a webmention receiver and some tools for POSSEing.

Submodules warning
------------------

Connection expects a bunch of submodules to be present the folder ```connection``` as subfolders. These are:

* [indietools](https://github.com/kartikprabhu/indietools) in ```connection/indietools```
* [mf2py](https://github.com/kartikprabhu/mf2py/tree/master/mf2py) in ```connection/mf2py```
* [ronkyuu](https://github.com/bear/ronkyuu/tree/master/ronkyuu) in ```connection/ronkyuu```
